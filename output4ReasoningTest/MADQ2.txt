 {"properties": {"DetailedExplainationsToConvinceOthers": {"title": "Detailed explanations to convince others", "description": "There are a total of 10 people, and each person has 7 friends among the other nine people, which means that each relationship is mutual and symmetric. We can create a graph where each person corresponds to a node, and connect two nodes with an edge if and only if the two corresponding people are friends. Since each person has 7 friends, the degree of each node is 7. The problem requires us to prove the existence of a clique of size 4, which means that there are 4 nodes in the graph such that each pair of nodes has an edge connecting them. One way to prove this is by contradiction. Assume that there is no clique of size 4 in the graph. Then, we know that any node has at most 6 neighbors, because if a node has 7 neighbors, then these 7 nodes would form a clique of size 7, which contradicts the assumption that there is no clique of size 4. Now consider any node A in the graph. Since A has 9 neighbors, and each neighbor has at most 6 neighbors (excluding A), the total number of distinct neighbors of A is at most 9*6 = 54.

DetailedExplainationsToConvinceOthers: Since there are 10 people in the group, each person has 9 friends. Let us assume that there is no group of 4 people who are friends of each other. Then, each person has 3 non-friends. If we draw all the social relationships between these people, any two people have exactly one mutual friend. But this is not possible since there are 10 people and at least 5 pairs of two people without a common friend. Hence, at least four people must be friends of each other.

By the pigeonhole principle, at least 2 of these nodes, say B and C, have a common neighbor, say D, not in the set of 5 nodes.

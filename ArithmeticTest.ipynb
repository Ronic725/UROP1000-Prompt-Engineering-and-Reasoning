First, we will perform the operations within parentheses, but since there are no parentheses given, we will move to exponents, but there are none. Next, we will perform multiplication and division from left to right.\\n\\nStarting with multiplication, -5 * -24 = 120. Next, proceeding with division, -27 * 22 / 22 = -27. Thus, the expression now becomes (-7) + 120 + 25 - (3) * (-2) - 27. Because multiplication has a higher order of precedence than addition and subtraction, multiplication should be computed first.
